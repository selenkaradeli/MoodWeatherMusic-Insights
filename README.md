# MoodWeatherMusic-Insights

## Project Outline  
Analyzing how everyday weather affects emotions and musical tastes is the goal of this study. In order to find significant patterns and observations, I intend to combine meteorological data, personal mood records, and Spotify music data. Data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization are all phases that will be included in this project.


## **Objective**
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To analyze the impact of weather on mood.
2. To investigate the relationship between mood and music preferences.
3. To combine insights from both analyses to understand how weather, mood, and music interact.


## **Plan**
### **1. Data Collection**
I will gather data from the following sources:
- **Weather Data:** Daily weather conditions for Istanbul in 2024, sourced from [Weather and Climate](https://weather-and-climate.com/).
- **Mood Data:** Daily self-reported mood ratings are recorded in an Excel document.
- **Spotify Data:** Spotify Web API-retrieved user-specific music information, including recently played songs and popular genres.

### **2. Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- Handle missing or inconsistent entries.
- Format data into a unified structure for analysis.

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Use visualization techniques like scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps to identify trends and relationships.

### **4. Insights and Findings**
- Investigate the relationship between mood and musical preferences and the weather (such as sunny or rainy).


## **Technologies to Be Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy`: For data processing.
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`: For creating visualizations.
  - `Spotipy`: For accessing Spotify data via its Web API.


## **Questions to Address**
1. How do different weather conditions (e.g., rainy, sunny) influence mood?
2. Which music genres are most frequently associated with specific moods?
3. Are there any trends connecting preferences for music and the weather?


## **Expected Results**
I expect to observe:
- **Rainy Days → Sad moods → Acoustic or calming music.**
- **Sunny Days → Happy moods → Energetic or pop music.**
- **Stressful Days → Relaxing playlists or instrumental music.**


## **Limitations**
- **Subjectivity of Mood Data:** Mood data will be self-reported, which may introduce bias.
- **Spotify API Constraints:** The API only allows access to data from the authenticated user's account.
- **Weather Data Granularity:** Weather data will be limited to daily averages rather than hourly details.


## **Future Work**
If time permits or in future iterations:
1. Automate mood tracking using sentiment analysis on text data (e.g., diary entries).
2. Include additional weather parameters like wind speed and humidity.
3. Develop a predictive model that recommends music based on real-time weather and mood inputs.


## **Acknowledgements**
This project relies on:
- [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/) for accessing user-specific music data.
- [Weather and Climate](https://weather-and-climate.com/) for weather data resources.


## **Deliverables**
Upon completion, this project will include:
1. A well-documented GitHub repository with all scripts, datasets, and results.
2. Visualizations that highlight key insights.
3. A summary report detailing findings and future recommendations.
